# Loan status prediction
In this project a machine learning analysis was made in order to predcit if a loan will be granted to a client or not. For this purpose Spark, HDFS and Mllib were used. The file note.json contains the notebook where the analysis took place, this notebook was created with Apache Zeppelin. In the following URL a PDF file with the content of the notebook can be downloaded: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A_PGufxG9tIEFNqIabJNF6Z9tDzIdZzu. Sorry for the bad quality but Apache Zeppelin currently doesn't have any exporting tool.
